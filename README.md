Troubleshooting
==================
- If the bot stopped working, try to re-target the game window, dragging the "Crosshair" tool from SCAR toolpanel to the flash screen of the game.
- Please, ensure the page scale is set to 100%. The bot will not recognise the fonts of the game otherwise.
- Bot can work properly only when the "Price" and the "Buy/Sell" columns of the Exchange screen are visible
- If bot strangely "jerks" the mouse cursor way too often, ensure that the "Purchase Volume" on the Exchange screen is set to 50% (NOT 100%)
